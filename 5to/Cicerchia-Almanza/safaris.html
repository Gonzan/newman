      <h3>Safari Tour Introduction</h3>
      <p>If you are short on time or perhaps you would like a quick insight into what Pilanesberg National Park can offer, the 1 day tour is a great option. Due to the limited time you will have to explore this Big 5 reserve, your day will be busy, but not rushed! Pilanesberg National Park is only a quick 2 hour drive from Johannesburg, which makes it the perfect destination for a 1 day safari tour. You will have the opportunity to see fantastic wildlife and soak in the incredible scenery in this Big 5 Game Reserve.</h3>
