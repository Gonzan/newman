    <p><span class="fusion-dropcap dropcap" style="color:#a0ce4e;">A</span>mong Southern Africa’s fascinating game reserves, Pilanesberg National Park is possibly the most accessible. Situated in the ecologically rich transition zone between the Kalahari and the Lowveld, this vast area promises thrilling big game viewing in a malaria free environment. A wide variety of accommodation is available to suit your needs.</p>

    <h3>Top Reasons to Visit</h3>
    <p>You may be wondering what sets Pilanesberg Game Reserve apart from other National Parks. What makes it so unique? Here are some of the best reasons to visit Pilanesberg:</p>

    <h4>Accessible</h4>
    <p>Only three hours’ drive away from South Africa’s largest city (Johannesburg), Pilanesberg National Park offers the perfect opportunity to leave the city lights behind, and discover another world. Celebrate the public holidays, or enjoy a romantic getaway in the unspoiled wilderness.</p>

    <h4>Variety of Accommodation</h4>
    <p>The diversity of Pilanesberg’s accommodation options means that there is an offering to suit every taste. Whether you enjoy “roughing it” in a Safari tent in the bush, or a savouring a glass of fine wine in a big bubble-bath as you gaze out the window of your luxury lodge, Pilanesberg has something just for you.</p>

    <h4>Ecological Richness</h4>
    <p>Pilanesberg National Park exists in a transition zone between the dryness of the Kalahari and the wet Lowveld vegetation. This rich transitional zone attracts an incredible variety of game animals, flora and fauna that are not often found living side by side. Virtually all of the animal species native to southern Africa can be found here, including the Big 5, wild dog, Roan, Tsessebe, Sable antelope and more than 360 species of bird.</p>

    <h4>Bursting with Wildlife</h4>
    <p>The relatively small size of the park, and its unusual ecological richness, dramatically increase your chance of encountering the Big 5 in their natural environment. Enjoy a leisurely Safari experience, or a surprise weekend escape: Pilanesberg allows you to choose your own adventure.</p>

    <h4>Ancient History</h4>
    <p>Pilanesberg National Park is set within the crater of an ancient volcano, formed 1.2 billion years ago by overflowing magma. The landscape and rock formations we see today are the enduring reminders of this magnificent occurrence.</p>

    <h4>Photographic Hides</h4>
    <p>Immerse yourself in the natural world, in one of Pilanesberg’s concealed photographic hides. Hidden within the park, these well-built hides provide a comfortable place to wait for that perfect shot. A rare opportunity to view the wildlife and birds in their natural habitat, safely out of sight.</p>
